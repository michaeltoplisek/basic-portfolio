                Hi! My name is Michael Toplisek. Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I was born in Pittsburgh PA so I
                love watching the Steelers, Pirates, and Penguins play.
                My family and I moved to Georgia when I was 8 years old. Gorwing up I loved hanging out with friends,
                playing sports, and playing the guitar. I continue to do all these things today.
                I have always liked creating things, especially music, which is part of the reason why I wanted to get
                into coding. It's very creative and rewarding.
                Theres no greater feeling than working on something and putting your all into it and see it come out at
                the end the way you invision it in your head.
            </p>

                I really enjoy travelling. I often go back to Pittsburgh to visit my family. My girlfriend and I enjoy
                taking trips together, and the last trip we went on was to Charleston SC.
                It was a very beautful city and I feel it is the epitome of a southern city. Two summers ago I went on
                a trip to Europe with my family. We visited England, France, Germany, and Slovenia.
                Slovenia was my favorite because it is where my heritage comes from on my fathers side and we took my
                Grandfather with us. We all visited an old monastary where my Grandfathers Great Grandfather was
                baptized.
                It was a beautiful place where they grow herbs for medicinal purposes now. My Grandfather got to see
                his Great Grandfathers name on a book showing he was there. It was very special.
